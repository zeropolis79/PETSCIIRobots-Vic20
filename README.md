# PETSCIIRobots-Vic20
Attack of the Petscii Robots VIC-20 Source Code
The Attack of the PETSCII Robots source code has been provided by David Murray for the purposes of study and also to provide information to those who would like to port
the game to other systems. This code may NOT be used to produce unofficial copies for sale and he code must NOT be modified in anyway unless adding a feature, in which both
the source and compiled versions must be sent to David Murray. 

Due to time constraints, David Murray will NOT be prodiving support. He has gladly given permission for me to host this.
